# project2-Team19

Course - CST205
Title - Face Recognizer from Web camera
Abstract - XML file (trained cascade individually) , Face detecting code, Opencv library
Authors - Ravinder Singh , Abraham De Alba , Stephanie Doan
Date - 14 october 2016


Ravinder Singh worked on detecting the face code by using youtube tutorials and also tried to train own cascade file but it seems broken. The probelem is addressed below.

Stephanie helped to install the linux on our systems.

Abraham helped to create the code to detect the face and also helped us to install opencv on our systems. 

How to run the program - Run the file webcam_cv3.py file in terminal with Cascadefile. To detect the individual face  please use own trained cascade file with the code.

Future work- We are still trying to make own cascade XML fle by using more tutorials.





I have tried three different tutorial to create an XML file. I will try to explain the problems with each tutorial I had.

1) URL Link for tutorial 1
https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~m.rezaei/Tutorials/Creating_a_Cascade_of_Haar-Like_Classifiers_Step_by_Step.pdf

In this one, I had issue at step 5 where you have to execute the haartraining.bat file. I asked Martin too but we were not able to figure out the problem. I also attached the screenshot with this email (tutorial1.jpeg) for you to look at the problem. I tried this in window since it was for windows.

This article was sent to me by Martin. I had problem with getting the mergevec.cpp tool. It looks like this article is outdated and does not have the tools to complete the tutorial. I have uploaded it on my google drive and the link is below

This is the last tutorial I tried and Martin helped a lot. We are stuck at creating the stages for cascade file. We tried to create 10 stages as Tutorial says, but we are getting failure error at stage 8 and then I tried to create only 4 stages, and then it gives error at last stage which is 4th stage. However, I tried to run the xml file of 8 stages and it detects everything and seems to be broken. I also attached the screenshot as (no.3 problem) and uploaded the folder on google drive with all the progress and here is the link

.Also, It get interrupted so many times while uploading this folder on google drive so it might not contains all the files in this folder on google drive.Also, I didn't include the opencv folder in that tutorial since it was a big file and you might already have opencv on your system.


Everything I did it was complicated for me but Martin helped a lot but still it didn't workout well.
